Based on the popular single-agent MuJoCo benchmark [4], MAMuJoCo features a wide variety of novel
robotic control tasks in which "multiple agents within a single robot have to solve a task cooperatively"

Multiple agents are created based on the notion on "partitioning" of the joint spaces of a mujoco
enabled robot
